## Supabase Setup

- [ ] Create Supabase project and note the project URL and keys
- [ ] Run all migrations: `npx supabase db push --linked`
- [ ] Verify Row-Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all user-facing tables
- [ ] Configure auth providers in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Providers:
  - Email/password (enabled by default)
  - Google OAuth (client ID + secret)
  - Phone OTP (Twilio credentials)
- [ ] Set auth redirect URLs to include production domain (`https://<domain>/auth/callback`)
- [ ] Verify database indexes exist for slug lookups and user queries

---

## Vercel Deployment

- [ ] Connect GitHub repo to Vercel project
- [ ] `vercel.json` is configured with `ignoreCommand` so only production (`main` branch) triggers deploys -- preview deploys on PRs are skipped to stay within free-tier limits
- [ ] Add all required environment variables in Vercel > Settings > Environment Variables
- [ ] Set `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` as build-time env vars
- [ ] Confirm production branch is set to `main`
- [ ] Enable Vercel Analytics (optional, for Web Vitals)

---

## Custom Domain

- [ ] Purchase or configure domain
- [ ] Add domain in Vercel > Settings > Domains
- [ ] Set DNS records (CNAME or A record as instructed by Vercel)
- [ ] Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (automatic)
- [ ] Update Supabase auth redirect URLs to use the custom domain
- [ ] Update CSP `connect-src` in `next.config.ts` if new API domains are added

---

## Monitoring (Sentry)

Sentry is integrated across all runtimes:
- **Client**: `sentry.client.config.ts`
- **Server**: `sentry.server.config.ts`
- **Edge**: `sentry.edge.config.ts`

Checklist:
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set in production
- [ ] Verify `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` are set for source map uploads
- [ ] Source maps upload automatically via `@sentry/nextjs` webpack plugin during build
- [ ] `automaticVercelMonitors: true` is enabled for Vercel cron/function monitoring
- [ ] Set up Sentry alerts for error rate spikes and new issue notifications
- [ ] Configure Sentry release tracking (ties deploys to error reports)

---

## Security Headers

The following headers are configured in `next.config.ts` and apply to all routes:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` -- prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` -- prevents MIME sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` -- disables camera, microphone, geolocation
- `Strict-Transport-Security` -- HSTS with 2-year max-age + preload
- `Content-Security-Policy` -- restricts scripts, styles, connections, frames
- `poweredByHeader: false` -- removes `X-Powered-By` header

## Secrets Rotation Schedule

| Secret | Rotation Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | On suspected compromise | Regenerate in Supabase Dashboard |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Every 90 days or on compromise | Rotate in Anthropic Console |
| `PINECONE_API_KEY` | Every 90 days or on compromise | Rotate in Pinecone Console |
| `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Every 90 days or on compromise | Rotate in Voyage AI Dashboard |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | On suspected compromise | Public key, but regenerate if abused |

After rotation:
1. Update the secret in Vercel environment variables
2. Trigger a redeployment
3. Verify the app functions correctly post-deploy
